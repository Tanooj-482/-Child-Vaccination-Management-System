# -Child-Vaccination-Management-System
 System to provide information, store records and help parents schedule vaccination appointments for their children.


How the Code Works:


User Registration:

The user is prompted to enter their username, child's name, and child's date of birth.
If the username already exists, a message is displayed; otherwise, the user is registered.
Book Appointment:

The user is prompted to enter their username, vaccine name, and the desired appointment date.
The appointment is booked if the username is found.


View Appointments:

The user enters their username to view all appointments associated with their child's name.


Send Reminders:

The system checks for upcoming appointments and sends reminders based on the current date.
Menu-Driven Interface:

The system provides a menu where the user can choose to register, book an appointment, view appointments, send reminders, or exit the application.
This interactive version allows users to input data manually and control the flow of the program based on their selections.
